# Homemade Pizza Recipe üçï

## Ingredients

**For Pizza Dough (Makes 3 Pizzas):**

- 500g All-Purpose Flour (Type 405)
- 250ml Water
- 21g Fresh Yeast (half a cube)
- 10g Salt
- 25ml Olive Oil

**Toppings:**

- Your favorite ingredients

## Instructions

### Pizza Dough

1. In a bowl, combine all the ingredients except the flour and lightly stir. Then add the flour and knead with a hand mixer (using dough hooks) for about 5 minutes.
2. Afterward, knead by hand for approximately 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.
3. Place the dough in a bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.
4. Divide the dough into 3 equal portions, knead each briefly, and shape them into balls. Place these balls in three small bowls and let them rest for another 60 minutes.
5. Finally, with your hands, shape the dough balls into round pizza bases (avoid using a rolling pin) and top them according to your preferences.

### Toppings

Feel free to customize your pizza with your favorite toppings. It's worth using high-quality ingredients, and remember, less is more. Don't overdo the toppings!

### Baking

For the best results, a hotter oven is better. Preheat your oven to 300¬∞C (572¬∞F) with a pizza stone if available. Bake the pizza for approximately 6-8 minutes. While a pizza stone and 300¬∞C aren't absolutely necessary, they yield optimal results.

## Tips

- For exceptional dough, prepare it a day in advance and let it rest in the fridge overnight. In this case, halve the amount of yeast.
- Ensure you knead the dough long enough. Don't cut corners in this step.
- Shaping the dough by hand may take some practice, but it's quickly learned. It's worth it, as using a rolling pin can deflate the dough.
- You can easily freeze the pizza dough. Shape it into rounds, spread tomato sauce, and then freeze. Once frozen, store it in a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn.
